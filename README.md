# Software and Programming 2

## Coursework 3

1. [X] Create three classes: Building, Elevator, and Customer.
2. [X] Equip the building with an elevator. Ask the user to decide upon the number of floors and the
number of customers.
3. [ ] Your program should have error checking to make sure the user inputs are valid. For example,
if a user gives non-integer inputs, notify the user that the inputs are incorrect and prompt again.
4. [X]  Each customer starts from a random floor, and has a random destination floor.
5. [ ] We are presuming we are in the USA so there is no floor numbered thirteen (should you
building be that high).
6. [X] Each customer will use the elevator only once, i.e., when a customer leaves the elevator, he/she
will never use it again.
7. [X] When all customers have reached their destination floor, the simulation is finished.
8. [ ]  Part of the grade on this project will be the appropriateness of your classes, methods, and any
exceptions you use. The quality of the code matters and the performance.
9. [ ]  All the classes require full javadoc, including the private methods (should there be any).
10. [ ]  Provide appropriate unit tests to check your methods.
11. [ ] Implement both your own strategy and the default strategy and then compare them. Your
strategy does not have to be better (your grade will not depend on it) but the comparison is required.
